### Hi, I'm Marce.

I'm passionate about technology since I was born, but only realised that I could make it about four years ago when I started working as a light designer and technician. Since then my life has completly shifted as I realised where my creativity comes from, and it comes from solving problems. 

Dispite my love for manual labor and eletronics, I found out that my one true love is programing :heart: As visual artist I fkng LOVE TouchDesigner (poorly documented here thanks to my hard-drive), where I wrote my first software with lots of Python scripts (so much fun!).

I'm currently discovering the land of FrontEnd and BackEnd with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (and dreaming about pentesting).
