### Hi, I'm Marce.

I'm passionate about technology since I was born, started my life as graphic designer and only realised that I could make technology about four years ago when I started working as a lighting designer and technician. Since then my life has completely shifted as I realised where my creativity comes from: solving problems. 

Despite my love for manual labour and electronics, I found out that my one true love is programing :heart: As visual artist I fkng LOVE TouchDesigner (poorly documented here thanks to my old hard-drive), where I wrote my first software with lots of Python scripts (so much fun!).

I'm currently discovering the land of FrontEnd and BackEnd with HTML, CSS, JavaScript e SQLite (and dreaming about pentesting).

Even though I'm still learning, I really like to share my knowledge as I believe the more you share the more you learn.
