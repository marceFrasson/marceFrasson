### Hi, I'm Marce.

marcefrasson@gmail.com

I'm passionate about technology since I was born, started my life as graphic designer and only realised that I could make technology about six years ago when I started working as a lighting designer and technician. Since then my life has completely shifted as I realised where my creativity comes from: solving problems. 

Despite my love for manual labour and electronics, I found out that my one true love is programing :heart: As visual artist I fkng LOVE TouchDesigner, where I wrote my first software with lots of Python scripts.

I'm currently studying Software Engineering at 42 SÃ£o Paulo, and even though I'm still learning, I really like to share my knowledge as I believe the more you share the more you learn.

I also work in a AI company learning backend.

Currently learning: C, Python and Java.
